# Lightshow

I wrote this to control the lights in our summerhouse and garden
using AWS IoT device shadows, which can be updated via a lambda
function and hence by Alexa.

In reality it's a generic IoT shadow to Raspberry Pi GPIO pin
controller. It could be used to turn anything on and off this way.
